<p>When minoritised languages undergo revitalisation, concerns around standardisation are often front and centre. Developing a standardised form of a language is seen as a fundamental step in encouraging literacy and the use of that language in official contexts such as education (Drapeau 2021: 402). This can entail the creation of a new language variety, or the selection of an existing variety, to serve as the standard, requiring language planners to make decisions about the type of language that best serves a potentially diverse community. This may involve choosing or creating a standard that includes features common to multiple varieties in order to represent as many speakers as possible, but can also be motivated by ideological concerns. To take Breton as an example of a minoritised language that saw multiple attempts at orthographic standardisation over the course of the twentieth century, the <em>peurunvan</em> orthography, now the de facto standard, uses the digraph &lt;zh&gt; to reflect different pronunciations by speakers of different dialects: /h/ among speakers in the south-eastern part of the traditionally Breton-speaking zone, and /z/ elsewhere. In terms of its lexis and grammar, however, the variety of Breton used in modern official materials leans towards the northwestern dialect, bolstered by a stronger religious tradition in the area leading to greater quantities of literary production into the early twentieth century (Wmffre 2007:8). This variety of Breton was believed to be more “correct” than other dialects by early twentieth-century language activists, having been less subject to influence from French, and so was advocated as the basis of the modern standard (ibid.: 10–11).</p>

<p>In situations of language revival, where a language has ceased transmission in the community, this geographical diversity is not necessarily the only form of variation to contend with when selecting a standard: if the language has been dormant for some time, language planners also have the opportunity to select a historical period to serve as the basis for the revived variety. Again, ideological concerns come into play here. Speakers may believe an earlier form of the language is linguistically purer due to its having been less affected by language contact: in the case of Cornish, which I discuss here, Wmffre (1998: 3) notes “a number of features in Late Cornish [i.e. Cornish as it was written in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries] that can be ascribed to the direct influence of English”. Accordingly, those who worked on reviving the language in the early twentieth century avoided the “broken forms” (Nance 1929:7) they identified in this variety, preferring the Middle Cornish of the medieval period. Alongside this, however, different ideologies have motivated the pursuit of different directions in the revival of Cornish, with some speakers nonetheless preferring Late Cornish as a more recently spoken variety, more connected to the local dialect of English and evident in the place names of west Cornwall. Others, meanwhile, have taken different approaches to the Middle Cornish base, choosing either to prioritise the spellings found in medieval texts and maintain these in modern orthographies, or to favour a new orthography based on the reconstructed phonology of the same texts. This multiplicity of approaches recognises the fact that speakers may have different beliefs about the purposes a language should serve; these beliefs are particularly important in cases of revived minoritised languages, where nearly all speakers have made the conscious decision to learn the language, often for reasons related to their identity. Such speakers will bring strong ideological motivations to their participation in the speaker community.</p>

<p>Cornish was last spoken as a community language by traditional speakers in the eighteenth century, but antiquarian interest in the language continued after this point, involving the publication of dictionaries, glossaries, and commentaries on medieval texts. The language revival movement is typically considered to have begun in 1904 with the publication of the first textbook, <em>A Handbook of the Cornish Language</em> (Jenner 1904). By the 2000s, the number of “effective speakers” was estimated at around 300 (MacKinnon 2005: 243). At the same time, recognition of Cornish under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages by the UK government resulted in a measure of officialisation for the language for the first time, with a publicly funded body, the Cornish Language Partnership, being set up to oversee language planning (Sayers 2012: 110). The Partnership initially concentrated its efforts on developing a standard orthography for Cornish, attempting to bring together the different systems that had been proposed over the years by compromising on an orthography that drew features from a number of varieties in use at the time. The resulting “Standard Written Form” (SWF) was implemented in 2008, but having failed to reconcile all speakers to one set of orthographic forms, it contained different “variant graphs”, establishing a system where speakers could choose from Middle and Late Cornish orthographic variants of equal standing, as well as “main” and “traditional graphs”, with the latter set considered secondary in status (Bock and Bruch 2008:2–4). This complex situation has been a source of confusion for speakers, as the discussion below will show.</p>

<p>The successful implementation of standard language varieties requires acceptance on the part of speakers (Haugen 1966: 933), and this is no less the case for orthographies. Notably, non-SWF orthographies of Cornish continue to be used, suggesting that while the SWF has been taken up in official contexts such as signage, it has failed to put an end to the diversity of orthographies used by individuals, adding to the existing heterogeneity rather than suppressing it. Two non-SWF orthographies in particular, Kernewek Kemmyn (“Common Cornish”) and Kernowek Standard (“Standard Cornish”), continue to be widely used, with Kernewek Kemmyn preferred by a number of teachers and available for use in the formal examinations offered by the Cornish Language Board, while Kernowek Standard is especially visible in publishing, including both novels and scholarly editions of traditional Cornish texts. Lexicographic works using both orthographies have also been published since the implementation of the SWF, providing an opportunity to compare a selection of dictionaries of different written forms of Cornish. In doing so, we can examine how the writers of these dictionaries position their favoured orthographies in order to demonstrate their legitimacy, revealing the ways in which linguistic authority is negotiated in this revived language context. I recently examined the front matter of four dictionaries from the post-SWF era, two using different forms of the SWF, one of Kernewek Kemmyn, and one of Kernowek Standard:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Kernowek Standard:</strong> Williams, N, J. A. (2014). <em>Geryow gwir: The Lexicon of Revived Cornish</em> (2nd edition). Cathair na Mart: Evertype.</li>
  <li><strong>SWF (Middle, Main):</strong> Harris, S., Harris, D., Harvey, P., and Harvey, R. (2019). <em>A Learners’ Cornish Dictionary in the Standard Written Form</em> (2nd edition). Redruth: Ors Sempel.</li>
  <li><strong>Kernewek Kemmyn:</strong> George, K. J. (2020). <em>An gerlyver meur</em> (3rd edition). Penzance: Cornish Language Board.</li>
  <li><strong>SWF (Late, Traditional):</strong> Kennedy, N. (2022). <em>The Annual English–Cornish Dictionary 2022.</em> Lostwithiel: Cussül an Tavas Kernôwek.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>A Learners’ Cornish Dictionary</em> uses Middle Cornish variants within the SWF, officially equal in status to, but more widely used than, the alternative Late forms. However, it misleadingly characterises the Middle Cornish forms as more central than their Late equivalents, suggesting that they are not to be considered variant forms in its statement that “to ensure that this dictionary is as easy to use as possible by children, other learners, and those producing material for use in public life, there are no spelling variants” (Harris et al. 2019: 3). The term “variants” is used in a different way here from its use in the SWF specification, implying that there is one set of principal forms that takes priority over other “variant” forms, and associating this primary set of spellings with Middle Cornish, going against the specification’s advice that Middle and Late are to be considered equal. On the other hand, this publication does make it very clear that it uses the SWF, both by making explicit reference to the orthography in its title, and by including information in the front matter that describe the SWF and give brief details of the political process that led to its creation.</p>

<p><em>The Annual English–Cornish Dictionary</em> similarly makes it clear that it uses the SWF, furthermore specifying on its cover that it uses Late (equal in status to Middle, but less widely used in practice) and Traditional forms (subsidiary, not used in official materials but accepted as part of the SWF) specifically. However, this dictionary moves away from the system laid out in the SWF specification (Akademi Kernewek 2021) by excluding some variant forms and introducing others that its author “hopes will be accepted” by language planners (Kennedy 2022: 9). Given that Late Cornish forms are a numerically minoritised variant of a language with few speakers anyway (the number of competent speakers being in the hundreds – see Sayers, Davies-Deacon and Croome 2019: 6), it is possible that these wishes could be taken into account in further corpus planning developments. However, moving away from the official prescription also risks further marginalising users of Late Cornish variants.</p>

<p><em>An gerlyver meur</em> uses Kernewek Kemmyn (Common Cornish), an orthography first developed in the 1980s on the basis of a reconstructed Middle Cornish phonological system, and continuously revised since. This orthography was presented to Cornish speakers as an improvement on existing systems largely because of its high rate of sound-spelling correspondence, making it theoretically easier for learners to acquire. At the time, it was officially adopted by the Cornish Language Board, then the only Cornish language association, and became widely used by speakers. Promotion of Kernewek Kemmyn focuses on its scientific rigour, being based on computer-assisted analysis of medieval texts, and this is alluded to in <em>An gerlyver meur</em>, which refers to the orthography as an “improved spelling” (George 2020: 9) and as “the best orthography available” (ibid.: 10) – prioritising assumed authenticity over sociolinguistic concerns. On the cover of the dictionary, there is no reference to the fact that it uses Kernewek Kemmyn, an unofficial orthography; this is revealed only several pages into the frontmatter. The primacy of traditional Cornish texts and the need for contemporary speakers to strive to emulate traditional Cornish is also emphasised in this dictionary, which notes that “the standard of pronunciation of many speakers is low” (George 2020: 11). This can be contrasted with the <em>Learners’ dictionary</em>, which suggests instead that “the language community itself will decide the future development of Cornish” (Harris et al. 2019: 39).</p>

<p>This focus on traditional Cornish is shared by the final publication, <em>Geryow gwir</em>, which is not a full dictionary but rather an annotated glossary of words the author considers important for speakers of revived Cornish, with references to their attestations in traditional texts. In this publication, it is claimed that “Cornish is unlike both Welsh and Breton in that it lacks native speakers. The closest learners of Cornish can come to the traditional language is in the Cornish texts in their original spelling. These should be the touchstone for our own attempts to speak and write Cornish” (Williams 2014: xvi–xvii). The author thus positions present-day speakers of Cornish as innately unable to meet the standards of traditional speakers due to their not being “native speakers” – debatable when some members of the Cornish language community have been transmitting Cornish to their children since at least the early 1990s. By referring to contemporary speakers of Cornish as “learners”, the author moreover implies that attaining full competence in revived languages is impossible due to the disruption in intergenerational transmission.</p>

<p>This volume makes no mention of the fact that it uses Kernowek Standard as its principal orthography (the numerous citations from traditional Cornish texts are given in their original spelling). In doing so, it obfuscates the fact that multiple orthographies exist for revived Cornish, and presents Kernowek Standard as a de facto standard – also implied by its name. Indeed, the names of all the orthographies discussed seem to give them some claim to legitimacy, presenting them as a default variety and obscuring the fact that they draw on certain beliefs about which types of Cornish form the most legitimate basis for the revived language.</p>

<p>It is striking that out of these four publications, it is the two using the SWF, supposedly the official orthography, that explicitly note which system they use on their covers. This suggests a certain level of insecurity about the SWF’s official status: if it had cemented itself as the de facto orthography for Cornish, we might expect its use to have become unmarked, and not to need to be foregrounded in this way. Indeed, the fact the development of the SWF tried to accommodate users of different varieties of Cornish as much as possible was perhaps the cause of its failure to displace the existing orthographies. By attempting to include both Middle and Late Cornish, and to account for different ideological approaches to the use of traditional Cornish as a basis for the revived language, the SWF fails to appeal to any particular set of beliefs about what Cornish should be. While the SWF materials appear to take a more tolerant view of variation and of the ability of contemporary speakers to shape the direction taken by Cornish in the future, they do not align with any specific ideological position, and hence this orthography (in its various forms) does not resonate with speakers who have made the deliberate choice to speak Cornish as an expression of their Cornish identity, like many new speakers of minoritised languages (see Smith-Christmas et al. 2018 for a number of relevant case studies). While pursuing politically neutral solutions to questions of language standardisation may help language planners meet goals relating to the capture of grant funding and the implementation of minoritised languages in official contexts, this method may not appeal to speakers, whose primary concern is the ability to use their language in a way that reflects and reinforces their strong attachment to the minoritised community of which they are part.</p>
