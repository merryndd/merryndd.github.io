<p>On Friday I went to look at some very amateur-looking publications produced by the various sides of the Cornish orthography debate during the 1990s, and this got me thinking about my own experiences with Cornish orthographies. Then, that night I had a brief written exchange in Cornish myself (courtesy of <a href="http://www.twitter.com/smgadd">smgadd</a>). Afterwards I realised that this was the first time I’d ever used Cornish to communicate with someone in writing. As I’ve known the language all my life, that’s a pretty odd thing to think.</p>

<p>Until very recently the only Cornish I really knew was the kind I’d learnt at my father’s knee (semi-literally, that is), i.e. some form of Richard Gendall’s “Modern” (i.e. Late) Cornish: memorably described <a href="http://www.urban75.net/forums/threads/are-the-welsh-a-conquered-people.2372/">here</a>, in a generally fairly inaccurate account of revived Cornish, as “utterly eccentric and … spoken by no-one”.</p>

<p>Learning Cornish natively but from a single oral source of input, I ended up not writing anything in Cornish at all until this summer when I was working through the exercises in <em>Clappya Kernowek</em>, and not seeing it written down very much until then either. So when I eventually learnt to read and write Cornish—and learnt the grammar properly—it was the Unified Cornish Revised version I learnt. So my grammar and spelling conformed with UCR and my spoken Cornish remained Late (LC).</p>

<p>This gets a bit more complicated by the fact that <em>Clappya Kernowek</em> was published in 1997, and the Standard Written Form for Cornish wasn’t developed until ten years later. As much as some people—mostly LC users—still resist the SWF, it has been broadly accepted, certainly by official organisations, and I feel I ought to use it, if only to demonstrate a sort of political neutrality as a researcher. So I continue to use UCR grammar (and continue to use LC orally), but end up looking up most words in <a href="http://www.cornishdictionary.org.uk/">the online SWF dictionary</a> in order to make sure I’m using the official spelling.</p>

<p>Where it gets even <em>more</em> complicated is in the fact that quite often, there’s a further choice to make. I’ve occasionally heard SWF spelt out as “<em>Single</em> Written Form”—there was actually a mailing list in the period leading up to its creation with the name “Udn Form Screfys” (“<em>One</em> written form”)—but this has never been a particularly accurate name. As the SWF involves a compromise between so many kinds of Cornish, there are a significant number of words that come with both Middle Cornish and Late Cornish forms, with both, theoretically, being equally acceptable. UCR is based on Middle Cornish, so perhaps I should use the Middle Cornish variants in writing in order to be consistent. But my “native” loyalties are with LC, and using the LC variants would help bridge the gap between the written and spoken forms, which for me is quite a large one.</p>

<p>Friday night was the first time I had to make this decision, and knowing that my interlocutor was an MC user, I went for MC. But in writing to a known LC user—or to myself—I’m certain that I’d use the LC forms. So, this is the way it appears that I use Cornish:</p>

<ul>
<li>spoken: (very) LC, with a horrible English accent</li>

<li>written:


<ul>
<li><em>either</em> SWF spelling (LC variants) with UCR grammar</li>

<li><em>or</em> SWF spelling (MC variants) with UCR grammar (when communicating with MC users)</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Most people, who will have learnt Cornish orally and in written form (scripturally?) from the same source, probably have a more sensible way of doing things, although it’s interesting to note that MacKinnon (2000)—before the SWF was really on the horizon—met one focus group member who said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>there’s a strange kind of collection of different ways you can put all this together so that you can find people using Kemmyn as an orthography but speak, if I can use that word, in Unified. You’ve got people who are, like myself, who are, who use Unified or a variant of it but tend to speak more like people who are using Nowedga [LC]. You’ve got the Nowedga people who speak like Unified</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regardless, it does seem pretty odd to be writing something like “<a href="https://twitter.com/merryndd/status/672884859094900736">pur dhe les yw, yth esov vy owth y komendya!</a>” and to be “pronouncing” the same thing as /θjuːˌpɜːɹəˈlɛːz ˌθɛɹəməikəˈmɛndjə/. As an ex-Romance linguist, I’m tempted to think of the “one-norm theory” proposed by Roger Wright (1982), who suggested that in around AD 500, people in what is now France would have been reading and writing a fairly standard kind of Latin but pronouncing it in some kind of proto-French way that wasn’t actually put into orthographic form until the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaths_of_Strasbourg">Strasbourg Oaths</a> in 842—not the most popular theory in the world, but maybe one that’s worth bearing in mind when thinking about authenticity and identity with regards to unstandardised, or partially standardised, languages.</p>
