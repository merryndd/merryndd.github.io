	<h2>Cornish</h2>
	<p>The form of Cornish I grew up with, and am most comfortable with, is usually known by its speakers as <i>Modern Cornish</i> or <i>Kernôwek Bew</i>. I&rsquo;ve compiled a few audio examples of this variety in <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1QIF_bvErHNkQKwdiuUaBmfx-jX-X6H_d">this folder</a>. Elsewhere on the internet, you can find some basic information about Modern Cornish <a href="http://www.moderncornish.net/">here</a>. For learners, I recommend <a href="http://latecornishlittlebits.blogspot.co.uk/">Jan Lobb&rsquo;s blog</a> (beginner&ndash;intermediate) and <a href="https://nebesgeryow.blogspot.co.uk/">Neil Kennedy&rsquo;s blog</a> (intermediate&ndash;advanced). There&rsquo;s also <a href="https://soundcloud.com/danny-prohaska">Dan Prohaska&rsquo;s audio course for beginners</a>.</p>
	<p>I&rsquo;ve also converted Nicholas Williams&rsquo; <i>Clappya Kernowek</i> into a <a href="https://www.memrise.com/course/735960/clappya-kernowek/">Memrise course</a>, although this is a different variety of Cornish and the orthography is now outdated.</p>
	<h2>Breton</h2>
	<p>On the subject of Memrise courses, I&rsquo;ve created a few for Breton based on existing materials: <i><a href="https://www.memrise.com/course/735982/brezhoneg-buan-hag-aes-english-complete/">Brezhoneg … buan hag aes</a></i> (for English speakers) and <a href="https://www.memrise.com/course/1329614/syntaxe-bretonne/">syntax examples</a> from <i>Hentenn Oulpan 1</i> (for French speakers), as well as some of the <a href="https://www.memrise.com/user/brezhoneg21/courses/teaching/">technical vocabulary lists</a> created by Kreizenn ar geriaouenn. In addition to this I have a long list of links to online resources, mostly passed on by helpful Breton teachers, that I hope to sort through and make public one day …</p>
