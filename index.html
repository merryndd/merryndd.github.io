	<h1>Merryn Davies-Deacon</h1>
	<p>I’m Merryn, a third-year PhD student at Queen’s University, Belfast, where I’m working on lexical variation in Breton and its relation to ‘new speaker’ identity as a member of the <a href="http://meits.org">MEITS</a> project.</p>
	<p>More generally, my work is usually on Cornish and/or Breton from a sociolinguistic perspective, focusing specifically on ideology and language standardisation, languages in the media, identity, and lexical variation. <a href="/cv">Click here</a> to view my full CV, including links to my research outputs.</p>
	<p>On this site I also list a few <a href="/resources">resources</a> in the domains of Cornish and Breton that I’ve created or compiled, and <a href="/news">very occasionally blog</a> about my research too.</p>
