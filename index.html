	<p>Hi, I’m Merryn, a second-year PhD student at Queen’s University, Belfast, where I’m working on lexical variation in Breton and its relation to ‘new speaker’ identity as a member of the <a href="http://meits.org">MEITS</a> project.</p>
	<p>My research interests are in sociolinguistics, specifically ideology and language standardisation, languages in the media, identity, and lexical variation. To find out more about my research, <a href="/cv">click here</a>.</p>
	<p>On this site I also list some <a href="/resources">resources</a> that may be of interest to anyone wishing to learn more about certain aspects of my research areas.</p>
