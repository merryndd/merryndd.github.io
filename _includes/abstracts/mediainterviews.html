<p>The media presence of Breton is of longer standing than that of many minoritised languages: radio broadcasts in Breton date back to the early twentieth century, and print publications to a still earlier period in the form of religious periodicals. More recently, the internet has provided a new way for media outlets to reach the speaker community; however, the circulation of media in Breton remains low, with even the most popular newspaper reaching fewer than 2000 regular readers. Traditional speakers of Breton, a rapidly shrinking category that still nonetheless forms the majority of the speaker population, are claimed in academic research to be reluctant to use Breton outside their local community, and unable to connect with the largely standardised language found in media contexts. New speakers, characterised as more willing and able to use Breton in a wider variety of domains, thus have a significant role to play in this field.</p>

<p>This paper will present data from interviews conducted with employees of Breton-language radio stations and magazines in the summer of 2018. As well as discussing some of the ways in which media in Breton employ strategies to reach speakers with diverse linguistic backgrounds, it will also highlight the role that digital content is beginning to take for media organisations, showing that a range of levels of engagement with such technologies can be observed, and that this engagement is not always as expected, given the organisation's perceived alignment with either standard or non-standard Breton.</p>
