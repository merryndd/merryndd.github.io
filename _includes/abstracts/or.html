<p>Within the last fifteen years, both Cornish and Breton have seen the establishment of an official, state-supported body to take charge of supporting revival/revitalisation efforts; as well as developing language policy, these bodies now play a major role in developing the languages’ lexicon and orthography (OPLB, 2015; Sayers and Renkó-Michelsén, 2015). As the ‘public faces’ of Cornish and Breton, their websites act as a major source of information for people who wish to find out about the two languages.</p>

<p>Orthography is an area in which revived Cornish and revitalised Breton have both been affected by intense debates (Harasta, 2013; Wmffre, 2008). Coming to agreement over a standard form of orthography has been prioritised as a way of making the languages more accessible to learners and giving them more legitimacy in the eyes of public bodies (MacKinnon, 2003). The question of Breton orthography was left open after a series of meetings in the 1970s failed to produce a standardised system agreed on by all parties (Wmffre, 2008, p. 259 ff.). A similar collaborative process succeeded in producing a ‘Standard Written Form’ of Cornish in 2008 (Harasta, 2013, ch. 7). Today, however, one particular written form of Breton is increasingly prominent (Chalm, 2009), whilst animosity towards the new Cornish orthography has meant that alternative forms have continued to be used after its implementation (as in George, 2009).<p>

<p>These contradictory histories are reflected in the websites of the relevant official bodies, showing different ways of dealing with orthographic diversity in the context of the official public face of a minority language. In examining how these two websites deal with the problem of orthographies, we can identify issues in language policy relating to the pressure to assimilate to “traditional nation-building strategies” (Wright, 2007, p. 170) that demand standardisation.</p>
