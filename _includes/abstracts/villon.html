<p>François Villon’s ‘incorrect’ use of Old French-style noun morphology in a short poem of 1461 has been called a <i>terminus ad quem</i> for the loss of the French case system, which in turn has been used to mark the end of the Old French period (see Smith, 2002). Pope (1952: §806) asserts that the inaccuracies in Villon’s use of archaic language show “that he had no understanding of the rules at all”, and this view is repeated by later scholars (e.g. Constanzo, 1978; Marchello-Nizia, 1997). However, this paper argues that Villon’s “mistakes” are in fact deliberate and in keeping with the highly sophisticated and subversive style of the rest of his poetry. In it I examine first the extent to which archaism is used in the poem, investigating its syntax and lexicon as well as its morphology, and then wider contextual issues such as other examples of false archaism in French literature and in the present day and evidence for Villon's linguistic skill as shown in the rest of his literary output. I conclude by suggesting that linguists concerned with defining stages of the evolution of the French language should be more cautious before using individual literary texts such as this one as evidence.</p>
