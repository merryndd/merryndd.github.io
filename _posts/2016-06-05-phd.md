Somewhere along the line I decided that this blog would go into some kind of hibernation period, and now that it’s furiously sunny outside I don’t suppose I can delay its return much longer. Here’s an explanation.

The main reason that I ended up not posting anything here for so long is that the first three or so months of this year were overwhelmingly taken up by PhD applications. Having failed to get funding for my MA but knowing that it was a long shot anyway and that I should just suck it up and benefit from my own natural money-hoarding tendencies for a year, I had somehow made the hugely naïve assumption that getting PhD funding would be easier. The last time I posted something to this blog I’d actually already put in one application and been rejected. Fine, I thought. It was a very prestigious university, I hadn’t really firmed up my intended research yet (it was December, I was still deciding on a direction for my MA thesis), there were a lot of other universities out there.

The first three and a half months of 2016 involved five applications, three interviews, three offers of unfunded places, and several rejections from various sources of funding, in an order that I was originally making an effort to remember but eventually lost track of. What I didn’t realise was that PhD funding is even more competitive than they say it is. Funding for nebulous projects in the humanities, loosely focused on languages with no more than 500 people, is, as it happens, not something one can find easily. I was informed on various occasions that competition was unusually strong this year, although of course it’s always hard to tell whether that’s true or just a platitude for unsuccessful applicants. This is how the process tends to go:

You email a potential supervisor (or they email you—thanks Dave—but that’s another story). They sound vaguely interested in your project. You submit the application. You meet the supervisor at an interview or elsewhere and after discussing your project a bit, they sound even more interested. They lend you a book because they’re so certain you’ll get the funding and be seeing them again in September to give it back. (This did actually happen to me on one occasion. I had to send the book back in the post. Awkward.) You submit a funding application to a panel that is almost certain not to have any members who know or care about your subject, trying to answer questions like “what will you bring to our highly motivated doctoral community” in fewer than 1000 characters. You wait a few weeks and eventually receive a nice polite rejection email. You wait another few weeks until the proposed supervisor emails to say what a shame and can I have my book back please.

The moral of the story is, hypothetical PhD applicant, don’t ever get complacent. Even if you have a first-class degree from Oxford (I do) and you’re already working on a research degree (I am), that doesn’t mean you’ll get anywhere, not even to the interview/first-round stage. I had overlooked this. The moral is, give up on the vaguely anthropological/discourse analytical sociolinguistics and go for hard science. My route to campus involves walking past a poster that proclaims 14 full scholarships in the biology department.

Funding for the humanities: a précis.

In the end, I was lucky. A mailing list I was subscribed to alerted me to a fully-funded studentship on multilingualism and identity with reference to minority languages of France. I applied with a not particularly developed research proposal, had a pretty informal Skype interview which consisted more of the two supervisors telling me about the project than actually asking me anything, and was told at the end of the interview that they were offering me the place. So at the end of September I’ll be starting a PhD at Queen’s University, Belfast, working on Breton sociolinguistics as part of the [Multilingualism: Empowering Individuals, Transforming Societies](http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N004671/1) project.

So it all worked out well for me in the end, after four months of dread and nervous speculation about my future during which I seriously considered becoming a full-time dog walker but also somehow managed to produce the first draft of my MA thesis. Instead of making a quiet and ignominious exit from academia, I now find myself financially and career-progressionally (not a word, but it does the job) stable for the next three years. And so the blog is back. As I write this I’m on the way to Glasgow to give my first grown-up conference paper (as opposed to the adolescent one I gave in January—more on that later, probably). An exciting future of job insecurity, research excellence frameworks and impact factors is one step closer to becoming a reality. For now, I’m going to read up on Irish history.
