<p>When I tell people I speak Cornish, or that I’ve worked on Cornish as part of my research, I never quite know what kind of reaction I’m going to get. Sometimes people haven’t heard of the language; other times they’ve heard a bit about it, but this might be inaccurate, based on stereotypes or incomplete information. So here are five commonly-repeated myths about Cornish, and the truths behind them.<p>

<blockquote><p>1. “Cornish isn’t a real language.”</p></blockquote>
<p>When people say this they’re probably assuming that Cornish and English are mutually intelligible. Leaving aside the fact that a lack of shared intelligibility isn’t what defines languages—what about Serbian and Croatian, or the various mutually unintelligible dialects of Chinese—this certainly isn’t the case, although people often assume that Cornish and English are closely linguistically related. This is probably a result of confusing the Cornish language with local dialect. Cornish dialect has its own interesting linguistic and social features, and is certainly worthy of study, but is a completely separate matter from the Cornish language. Cornish is a Celtic language: its closest relative that most English speakers will be aware of is Welsh. While a sizeable portion of Cornish vocabulary is shared with English, the language can’t be understood by somebody who has no knowledge of Celtic languages.</p>

<blockquote><p>2. “The last Cornish speaker was Dolly Pentreath.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Antiquarian interest in Cornish began as early as the late eighteenth century, and Dolly Pentreath was identified by a scholar as “the last Cornish speaker” a few years before her death in 1777. Since then, she’s become a figurehead for the death of Cornish, and is still cited with this description. However, habitual users of Cornish could be found in the decades after Dolly died, and there are records of Cornish being used well into the nineteenth century. As research on use of the language during this era progresses, more and more evidence of Cornish being used at this late stage is being unearthed. And, of course, there’s an increasing number of Cornish speakers today, which leads us to the next myth:</p>

<blockquote><p>3. “Cornish has been revived.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The revival of Cornish started just over a hundred years ago, and has recently gained much more interest and visibility, aided by the internet’s ability to host resources and connect speakers who may not live close enough to each other to meet in person. That doesn’t mean that the revival of the language is complete, though. Research and debates are still ongoing on the linguistic features that Cornish should have, and there’s a lot of work to be done towards recognition of the language on a wider scale, which is an equally important part of the revival process. Even if there is a point at which language revival can be called complete, Cornish isn’t there yet.</p>

<blockquote><p>4. “There are no native speakers of Cornish.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s true that intergenerational transmission of Cornish was very restricted by Dolly Pentreath’s time, and later ceased entirely. But that doesn’t mean it hasn’t begun again during the era of revived Cornish: not everyone learns the language from books and evening classes. I’m one of a number of people who was brought up with Cornish spoken in the home—in my case, alongside English, and I’d describe myself as a native speaker of both. There are numerous cases of people who have been brought up with only Cornish in the home, and have nonetheless gained full competence in English due to its being the dominant community language, so it’s not as if exposure to Cornish in childhood will harm the child’s chances of acquiring English.</p>

<blockquote><p>5. “If you speak Cornish, you think Cornwall should be an independent country.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Ideas of language and nationhood are often tied together at the level of widely-spoken languages such as English and French, and the effect of this political discourse can trickle down to minority languages. While it’s true that a lot of people active in Cornish regionalist politics are also members of the Cornish language community, there’s certainly no obligation for Cornish speakers to be political militants. However, that’s not to say that a greater level of political devolution to Cornwall might not benefit the language in terms of funding and status, so it’s perhaps easy to see why some Cornish speakers have particular political views …</p>
